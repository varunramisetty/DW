// The DataWeave code is used to transform a CSV input payload with no headers into a CSV output payload with no headers.
// The code uses the input and output directives to specify the format of the input and output payloads, respectively.

// The code then uses the map function to iterate over every two rows of the input payload. For each pair of rows, 
// the code concatenates the values of the first column of each row with a semicolon separator. The resulting string is
// assigned to the column field of the output row.

// Finally, the code returns an array of output rows, which is automatically converted to a CSV output payload by the
// output directive.
